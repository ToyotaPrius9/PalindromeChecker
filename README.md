This simple java code uses the implementation of stack and offers custom user input. The stack used in this case is: imported. Not some fancy tryhard custom made stack or anything...

I dumped this code with comments on most existing lines for easy understanding, hope that's somewhat readable...

why would anyone even read me :/
